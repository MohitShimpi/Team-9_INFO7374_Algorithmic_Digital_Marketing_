There were some really cool little details like free 24 cold brew in the lobby, to the bottle of champagne delivered to my room because it was my birthday, to the zebra rock ‘n’ roll robes, and the most unique thing was the in-room record player and the huge library of vinyl that you could choose from to bring up to your room The location also cannot be beat, a few minutes walk to the green line train and Fenway Park was right out my window! So very cool!","Real"
